# Using the API

### Overview
This task focuses on creating an API for managing a player character's Hit Points (HP) within our game. The API will enable clients to perform various operations related to HP, including dealing damage of different types, considering character resistances and immunities, healing, and adding temporary Hit Points. The task requires building a service that interacts with HP data provided in the `briv.json` file and persists throughout the application's lifetime.

### Instructions to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository or obtain the project files.
2. Open the Solution in your preferred IDE or CD into the Solution Directory.
3. .
4. Build and run the API service locally.
5. Utilize the provided `briv.json` file as a sample character data, including HP, for testing the API.

### Additional Notes
- Temporary Hit Points take precedence over the regular HP pool and cannot be healed.
- Characters with resistance take half damage, while characters with immunity take no damage from a damage type.
- Use character filename as identifier
